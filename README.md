* Sruthi Rajeswari
* Austin Brantley
* JD Wright


## Data Sets:
Restaurant and Market Health violations and Inspection - From: Kaggle
LA Health Inspection Report



### Objectives
* E: Reading csv files for inspections and violations. Scrapped Yelp for restaurant rating.

* T: Iterate inspections and insert violations into inspection

* L: Store data in Json form to load into Mongo DB


### Summary
When we first started out, it was difficult to nail down how we were going to Extract our data. Eventually we settled on the idea of grabbing 2 CSV files from Kaggle. These files are records of restaurant health inspections in LA.

Our first challenging goal was to transform the data into a convenient format for analysis. With these two files separate it would be difficult for anyone to gather useful conclusions from the Datasets. We used Pandas to consolidate every individual violation of a restaurant. Then, it is nested inside a single column of the original master DataFrame.

Our goal at this point was to scrape yelp for the ratings of all the restaurants inspected and include in the inspection summary. The motivation behind this is to give the Analyst more to work with.

Finally, load the data into MongoDB.
